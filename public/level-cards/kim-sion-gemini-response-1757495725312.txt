**Kim Sion - Banana Scholar**

**(Card Frame:  A richly detailed golden frame with ornate flourishes, reminiscent of a vintage book cover.  The background of the frame is a deep, rich brown, subtly textured to resemble aged parchment.)**

**Top Center:** **LEVEL 10** (in a bold, stylized font, perhaps with a magical glow effect)

**Character:**

* **Kim Sion (김시온)** is depicted in a dynamic, confident pose. He's a humanoid banana with a charming, slightly mischievous anime-style face.  His expression is one of quiet confidence and intellectual prowess.
* He wears flowing, elegant robes in shades of deep brown and gold, accented with sapphire blue trim.  The robes are slightly billowing, suggesting movement and magical energy.
* A graduation cap sits jauntily atop his head, slightly askew, adding to his playful yet scholarly persona.
* He holds a glowing, ancient-looking spellbook aloft in one hand, with magical runes subtly glowing on its cover.  Sparks of magical energy emanate from the book.
* Around him, floating books and scrolls drift gently, their pages illuminated with a soft, ethereal glow.  Magical symbols, reminiscent of Korean calligraphy, are subtly etched into the floating books and scrolls.

**Magical Effects:**

* A vibrant yellow aura surrounds Kim Sion, pulsating with gentle energy.  This aura is brighter and more intense around his hands and the spellbook.
*  Sparkles and shimmering particles dance in the air around him, adding to the magical atmosphere.
*  Subtle, swirling magical energy patterns in shades of blue and gold emanate from his hands and the spellbook, creating a dynamic visual effect.
*  Spell circles, faintly glowing, appear beneath his feet and around the floating books, further enhancing the magical ambiance.

**Background:**

* The background is a stylized fantasy magical academy library, filled with towering bookshelves, floating scrolls, and glowing magical symbols etched into the walls.  The overall color palette is warm and inviting, using shades of brown, gold, and deep blues.

**Bottom Center:**

* **Experience:** 1686 XP / 17 Hours

**Overall Style:**

The art style should be vibrant and dynamic, capturing the energy and excitement of a magical academic adventure. The color palette should be rich and warm, using golds, browns, yellows, and blues to create a visually stunning and captivating card. The level of detail should be high, showcasing the character's personality and the magical elements of the setting.  The Korean manhwa/webtoon influence should be evident in the character design and dynamic linework.
